# Starting from scrath
> _"To build a tower that is strong, you must start with a sturdy brick."_

I don't who said that, this sentence summarizes exactly my thinking.  
Start from scratch, understand your basics better, and build one layer at a time.

## About me
ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is Ruben! 

I am fullstack web developer.  
I build websites on a daily basis, but what I like the most is to build applications.  
Applications represent this tower, that has several layers, some simple, others complex, and built for a purpose.  
This is what I want to achieve:  
To built something, that has an impact on this world, that inspires, just like a tower.  

ðŸ˜„ In any case, welcome and thank you for your visit!
